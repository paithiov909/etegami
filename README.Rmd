## Overview

etegami is an experimental viewer for nativeRaster images in R,
rendered on an HTML5 `<canvas>` element via your browser.
It provides a lightweight mechanism for visualizing raster graphics generated in R,
particularly from graphics devices like `ragg::agg_capture()`.

Instead of writing out PNGs or relying on heavy viewer infrastructure,
etegami encodes nativeRaster images as JSON
containing gzipped and base64-encoded pixel data, along with the image's width, height, and an identifier.
These JSON files can be sent to the browser and decoded into `ImageData`.

The viewer can:

* Load multiple JSON files and display them in sequence, like a slideshow.
* Pause and resume playback interactively.
* Capture canvas state changes and record them as a WebM animation.

## Why?

This project started as a personal exploration to make R graphics easier to work with when using VSCode.
Existing tools like [httpgd](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd) are really powerful,
but can be inflexible when switching to render raster images.

Additionally, rendering to `<canvas>` opened up the possibility of recording animations directly in the browser.

## Usage

Typical usage looks like this:

```r
library(etegami)

# 1. Start a viewer server and prepare a capture device
postino <- setup()

# 2. Draw something and capture it
plot(1:10)
last_plot <- post(postino)  # manually trigger capture

# 3. Open the viewer in your browser
browse(postino, last_plot)

# 4. Stop the server and close the capture device
shutdown(postino)
```

You can also wrap plotting calls with `mask_plot()`:

```r
postino <- setup(mode = "live")
plot <- mask_plot(postino)
plot(rnorm(100)) # automatically opens the viewer in a new window every time `plot()` is called
```
